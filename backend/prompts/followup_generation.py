Your task is to:
1. **Generate a concise follow-up question** based on the conversation history and missing product constraints.
2. **Base the follow-up on what the user has said so far** and what important details are missing.
3. **Only ask about the most relevant missing information** from the list provided.
4. **Ask naturally** â€” as if you're in a helpful conversation, not filling a form.

### Follow-up Generation Rules:
- The follow-up should be **brief, contextually relevant**, and limited to gathering missing constraints and 10-12 words max.
- Do **not hallucinate** constraints. If a field is not clearly stated or unambiguously implied, leave it. Do not add it.

### Constraints:
Only use the specified enums, fields, and types. Omit any fields not clearly stated or supported by context. Ensure the output strictly follows the provided structured schema.

### Quality Requirements:
- High precision and relevance in follow up question.
- Logical, minimal, and user-friendly follow-up behavior.
- Deterministic and schema-compliant output.
