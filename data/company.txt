EverGlow Labs – Brand Philosophy
EverGlow Labs exists to prove that nature and science can co-author skincare that actually works.
We formulate every product around three uncompromising pillars:
1.	Plant-Powered, Clinically Proven
• 100 % vegan, cruelty-free, and silicone-free.
• We pair high-potency botanicals (rosewater, cactus enzymes, oat lipids) with gold-standard actives (retinaldehyde, peptides, ceramides) validated in peer-reviewed studies.
• Every finished formula undergoes third-party in-vitro and in-vivo testing for efficacy and safety.
2.	Radical Transparency
• Full-dose percentages of hero ingredients on every carton.
• Carbon-neutral supply chain; FSC-certified packaging and soy inks.
• Real, verified customer reviews only—no paid placements, no bots.
3.	Barrier-First, Planet-First
• pH-optimized, microbiome-friendly formulas that respect your skin barrier.
• Cold-processed where possible to reduce energy use and preserve phyto-nutrients.
• 1 % of revenue funds reef-safe sunscreen education and re-wilding projects.
The result: skincare, body care, and haircare that deliver visible results without compromising ethics, the environment, or your wallet.
