## Technology Stack

### Backend

**Decision**: Flask for the backend API
- **Rationale**: Flask provides a lightweight, flexible framework that's well-suited for API development and integrates easily with AI/ML libraries.
- **Alternatives Considered**: FastAPI, Django
- **Trade-offs**: Flask is less opinionated than Django, allowing for more flexibility but requiring more manual configuration. It's not as performance-focused as FastAPI but has a larger ecosystem and better compatibility with existing libraries.

**Decision**: Python for backend language
- **Rationale**: Python is the dominant language in AI/ML development with extensive library support for LLMs, vector databases, and data processing.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Node.js, Java
- **Trade-offs**: Python may not be as performant as Java or Go for high-throughput services, but its ecosystem for AI/ML is unmatched.

## Architecture Decisions

**Decision**: Microservices architecture with Docker
- **Rationale**: Separating the frontend, backend, and database services allows for independent scaling and deployment. Docker provides consistent environments across development and production.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Monolithic architecture, serverless
- **Trade-offs**: Microservices add complexity to deployment and service communication but provide better scalability and maintainability. Docker adds overhead but ensures consistency across environments.

**Decision**: RESTful API for service communication
- **Rationale**: REST provides a simple, stateless protocol for service communication that's well-understood and widely supported.
- **Alternatives Considered**: GraphQL, gRPC
- **Trade-offs**: REST is simpler than GraphQL but less flexible for complex data requirements. It's more widely supported than gRPC but less efficient for high-throughput services.

**Decision**: Stateful conversation management with Lang-graph
- **Rationale**: Lang-graph provides a structured approach to managing conversational state, allowing for complex conversation flows and context management.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Custom state management, stateless conversations
- **Trade-offs**: Lang-graph adds complexity but provides better conversation management capabilities. It's more opinionated than custom solutions but provides better tooling and abstractions.

## Data Management

**Decision**: ChromaDB for vector storage
- **Rationale**: ChromaDB provides efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings, which is essential for semantic search and retrieval.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Pinecone, Milvus, FAISS
- **Trade-offs**: ChromaDB is less feature-rich than Pinecone but is open-source and can be self-hosted. It's less performant than FAISS for large-scale deployments but provides better integration with Python ecosystems.

**Decision**: JSON for product data storage
- **Rationale**: JSON provides a simple, flexible format for storing product data that's easy to work with in both Python and JavaScript.
- **Alternatives Considered**: SQL database, NoSQL database
- **Trade-offs**: JSON is less structured than SQL but more flexible for evolving schemas. It's less scalable than dedicated databases but simpler to set up and maintain for small to medium datasets.

**Decision**: Excel for data ingestion
- **Rationale**: Excel is widely used for data management and provides a familiar interface for non-technical users to prepare and update product data.
- **Alternatives Considered**: CSV, direct database input
- **Trade-offs**: Excel is less efficient than CSV but provides better support for complex data structures and formatting. It requires additional processing compared to direct database input but is more accessible to non-technical users.

## AI and LLM Integration

**Decision**: LangChain for LLM orchestration
- **Rationale**: LangChain provides a comprehensive framework for working with LLMs, including prompt management, chain composition, and tool integration.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct API calls, custom orchestration
- **Trade-offs**: LangChain adds abstraction overhead but provides better tooling and abstractions for complex LLM workflows. It's more opinionated than custom solutions but reduces development time.

**Decision**: OpenAI API for LLM function calling
- **Rationale**: OpenAI provides state-of-the-art language models with excellent performance for classification and extraction.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Gemini, Anthropic, open-source models
- **Trade-offs**: OpenAI is more expensive than open-source alternatives but provides better performance and reliability. It requires API keys and internet connectivity but eliminates the need for local model hosting.

**Decision**: Google Gemini API for response generation
- **Rationale**: Gemini provides high-quality, cost-effective language models that excel at generating detailed, contextually relevant responses.
- **Alternatives Considered**: OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude, open-source LLMs
- **Trade-offs**: Gemini offers competitive pricing compared to OpenAI while maintaining high-quality outputs. It has strong multilingual capabilities and content generation but may have different strengths in certain specialized tasks. Using both OpenAI and Gemini provides redundancy and allows leveraging the strengths of each model for different aspects of the application.


**Decision**: Embedding-based retrieval for product search
- **Rationale**: Embedding-based retrieval provides semantic search capabilities, allowing users to find products using natural language queries.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Keyword search, faceted search
- **Trade-offs**: Embedding-based retrieval is more computationally expensive than keyword search but provides better semantic understanding. It requires vector storage and embedding generation but enables more natural user interactions.

## Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Docker for containerization
- **Rationale**: Docker provides consistent environments across development and production, simplifying deployment and reducing environment-related issues.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Virtual machines, bare metal
- **Trade-offs**: Docker adds overhead but ensures consistency across environments. It requires learning Docker-specific concepts but simplifies deployment and scaling.

**Decision**: Docker Compose for local development and testing
- **Rationale**: Docker Compose provides a simple way to define and run multi-container applications, making it easy to set up development environments.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Manual container management, Kubernetes
- **Trade-offs**: Docker Compose is less powerful than Kubernetes but simpler to set up and use. It's more opinionated than manual container management but reduces setup time and complexity.
